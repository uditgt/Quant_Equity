# Quantitative Equity Research

Result replication for Andrew Ang's paper "The Joint Cross Section of Stocks and Options"
- Developed SAS code base to combine data from IvyDB with that from CRSP and COMPUSTAT
- Results in Table 5 of the published paper are incorrect (no incremental predictability after Month 1). See presentation for correct results.

Plus a fairly robust and consistent replication of monthly returns for Fama-French 5 Factor model. #DevilInTheDetails
